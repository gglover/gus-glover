<h3>Training myself to wake up with data</h3>
<p>Yesterday I woke up at 800AM and found myself in the same position three and a half hours later. It wasn't the worst three and a half hours I've ever spent, in fact, it was relatively fulfilling from a hedonistic viewpoint. I was able to read a bit, catch up on couple shows and generally clear my mind up for better or for worse. Unfortunately, this meant that I wouldn't leave my desk until 830PM that night which offsets dinner, among other things, to a pretty unreasonable timeslot.<br/><br/>


It's not at all difficult to find yourself in a situation like mine; I'm sure we've all grappled with it. Consciously pushing the better half of your brain aside to bask in lackadaisically in a morning haze. For me, I’m fueled by a shockingly relaxed work schedule and an addiction to the feeling of justified unaccountability. If I’m in bed I may well be held to the same standards as if I were sleeping. Here, in this desparate life-hack, I will try to lasso some accountability into my life and reclaim my mornings through plotting and publishing my bedtime, alarm time and time of leaving the bedroom. We’ll see if this works.</p>

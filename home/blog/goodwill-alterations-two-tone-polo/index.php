<h1>Two-tone Polo</h1>
<h4>Goodwill Alterations #4 | <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-asymmetric-cargo-shorts">< prev</a> - <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-corduroy-thigh-pockets">next ></a></h4>

<p>The simple concept here is to take a cheap polo and extend the arms down to just below the elbow. This is my first attempt at working properly with an annoying knit fabric.</p>

<p>These two polos were found adjacent to each other on the rack, both too small.</p>

<p>I had to expand out the midsection with a vertical stripe along the side seam to avoid lookng like a pressed sausage. That piece comes to a point just under the armpit where the sleeve is attached. The arms were sewn in right over the elstic band with a double-headed needle for stretch. I couldn't come up with a clever way to hide this seam without destroying the shirt. It doesn't look great but it's something only I would notice. Overall I'm happy with the design, I'll have to pray the stitching holds up.</p>

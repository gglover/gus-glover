<h1>Two-tone Polo</h1>
<h4>Goodwill Alterations #4 | <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-asymmetric-cargo-shorts">< prev</a> - <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-asymmetric-corduroy-thigh-pockets">next ></a></h4>

<p>The simple concept here is to take a cheap polo and extend the arms down to just below the elbow. This is my first time working properly with an annoying knit fabric.</p>

<p>These two polos were found adjacent to each other on the rack, both too small. I had to expand out the midsection with a vertical stripe along the side seam to avoid lookng like a pressed sausage.</p>

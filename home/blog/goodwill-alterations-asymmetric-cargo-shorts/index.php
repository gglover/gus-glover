<h1>Asymmetric Cargo Shorts</h1>
<h4>Goodwill Alterations #3 | <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-block-jumper">< prev</a> - <a href="/blog/goodwill-alterations-two-tone-polo">next ></a></h4>

<p>For this project I decided to tackle a long ridiculed symbol of grandpawear: cargo shorts. For the most part these things are designed with cavernous leg space and the whole rack down to 29s at Goodwill could have fit a thigh and a half.  It seems like the slim-fitting cargo-anything is difficult to find in the men’s designer space. <a href="https://www.grailed.com/listings/444907-Undercover-14AW-Zip-Around-Cargo-Pants">Undercover</a> has some interesting old pieces and Julius has a famous line of cargos but beyond that there’s hardly anything. Anyway, those are out of the question, we want to move the price point from $800 to $20.</p>

<p>The thighs added to be taken in a few inches from the inseam which caused the legs to billow outwards just a bit. I made the large pocket Appliqué by seam ripping both pockets off the original shorts and mounting them on the corduroy harvested off the Cartini pants. It was fairly tedious mounting the whole thing with the newly tapered pant leg; there was scarce room to maneuver the piece under the machine’s foot so I doubled down on pins everything stayed tightly coupled. The space between the appliqué and original shorts actually functions as a pocket although I’d be hard pressed to find a use for it.</p>

<p>I don’t know many hard rules about clothing construction but I was still able to infer a lot of next steps by looking at garments that I already own. The construction isn’t Dior quality but it’ll last a few washes at least. If it jostles loose from wear I know how to fix it, anyway.</p>
